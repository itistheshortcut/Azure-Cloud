### Key Terms

- Cloud Computing
- economies of scale
- consumption base model or pay-as-you-go
- public
- private
- hybrid
- IaaS
- PaaS
- Serverless
- SaaS
- Vertical scaling is scaling up
- Horizontal scaling is scaling down

### [Click Here: Terms NOT in slide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/principles-cloud-computing/3c-capex-vs-opex)

- Server costs
- Storage costs
- Network costs
- Backup and archive costs
- Organization continuity and disaster recovery costs
- Datacenter infrastructure costs
- Technical personnel

### Key Concepts NOT in slide

- Vendor lock-in: `Company’s data is stored to a vendor´s cloud storage provider, A company has a vendor for all services or Changing a vendor is too costly`

- Compute Power: `Server power and speed is on a virtual machine in minutes rather than in a physical location`

- Containers: `Similar to VMs but with no guest OS, files, dependencies, and applications are packed into one allowing for faster process speed`

- Storage: `storing data on the cloud is scalable`

### Benefits of Cloud

- Cost Effective: pay as you go or consumption based
- Scalable: increase or decrease on demand at anytime
- Elastic: Cyclical business cycles does not effect automatically adding or removing resources
- Current: Cloud service is always up-to-date, requires no maintenance
- Reliable: Has data integrity and data is available when needed at anytime anywhere
- Global: Cloud can reach to different market place, regions providing maximum service level
- Secure: Data is secured with MicroSoft
